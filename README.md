Description ðŸ’¥
In the realm of machine learning, the choice of the right algorithm can significantly impact model performance.
This project delves into a comparative analysis of two prominent algorithms,
Decision Trees and Random Forest, both trained on the same dataset.
##Decision Trees: Our analysis reveals that the Decision Tree algorithm achieved a higher accuracy score compared to Random Forest. Decision Trees are known for their simplicity and interpretability. They work by dividing the dataset into smaller subsets based on the most significant attributes, creating a tree-like structure. This straightforward approach often results in accurate predictions,
especially when the relationships within the data are relatively simple.
##Random Forest: 
Random Forest algorithm, which is an ensemble of multiple Decision Trees, yielded slightly lower accuracy in this specific scenario. Random Forests are renowned for their 
robustness and ability to handle complex datasets. By combining the predictions of multiple Decision Trees, they reduce overfitting and improve generalization. However, their 
complexity may lead to slightly lower accuracy in certain cases, as observed in our analysis.
